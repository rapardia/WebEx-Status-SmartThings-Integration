# WebEx-Status-SmartThings-Integration

This code uses the pysmarthings library to integrate with the SmartThings API.

The script pulls your current WebEx Status using the /people/me API call every 5 seconds (configurable).

- If your status is Active, it changes the selected light to green
- If on a call or in a meeting, orange
- If presenting, red
- and if inactive, it turns the light off.

I have this working with my SmartThings connected Sylvania LED strip. The goal is to put it around my office door frame to let my family know when I'm in a meeting.

# Instructions:
## For my_status.py:
The webex_creds.py file will hold your WebEx token. 
The st_creds.py file will hold your SmartThings Token.
The refresh.py file will hold your WebEx refresh token and required info to refresh your token when it expires - this will NOT work if you are using your personal access token, which expires after 12 hours.
For the above files: Open the file in a text editor and Insert your Token between the single quotes like below:

### SmartThings Setup:
When we first run "my_status.py" it will list your SmartThings devices in a numbered list like below:

Once you enter the number of the device you want to use, it will start monitoring your WebEx status with the below output:

### WebEx Token Refresh
If you're using an integration access token and not a Personal access token, you can un-comment the "token_refresh" module (lines 114-126) and add your refresh data (refresh key, client id and client refresh) to the data.py file as below:

## For my_status_interactive.py:
This version is more user-friendly removes the need for the credential files. The credentials are added manually at the launch of the program before device selection.
